My A-Level coursework from the pandemic year - and therefore that had no effect on my grade :(

I was having a dig through old files and found it though, so here it is in all its limited glory. Runs on Windows but is extremely temperamental and I'm not gonna do anymore to it now. Also, the source code isn't commented because the original source code was lost so instead we have whatever jd-gui gave me, with a few tweaks. Original code made in Processing.
